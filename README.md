# Seating Arrangement Optimization Algorithms

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of three optimization algorithms used to find the optimal seating arrangement to minimize conflicts based on a given dislike matrix. The algorithms included are:

- Genetic Algorithm
- Simulated Annealing
- Hill Climbing

The results of running the application multiple times are shown in the report, which also analyzes the algorithms and compares their performance.
